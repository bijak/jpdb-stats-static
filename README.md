# jpdb-stats-static


The hosted version of this can be found at https://jpdb-stats.andmore.coffee/

To use: just upload the reviews.json file you can download at the bottom of the settings page at https://jpdb.io/settings

Let me know on the JPDB Discord if you have any requests or want to add anything to the site yourself!

(and big thanks to @nico-abram for rewriting this in JS so I could make you all do the processing in your browsers instead of paying for a server)
